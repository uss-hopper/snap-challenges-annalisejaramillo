		<h2>Master Branch</h2>
		<p>the Master Branch should never be developed on. It should be merged with the development branch only when each sprint is ready for release. </p>
		<h2>Development Branch</h2>
		<p>your Development Branch is for each sprint, your Feature Branches get merged with this branch while your on specific sprint </p>
		<h2>Feature Branch</h2>
		<p>You make individual tickets in an individual Feature Branch, when you finish each ticket you merge that tickets Feature Branch
			to the Development Branch</p>
		<h2>Sprint Release</h2>
		<p>a copy of the Master Branch thus far to test the merge of the Development Branch and the Master Branch before you actually merge them</p>
		<h2>Hot Fix</h2>
		<p>To use only in actual emergencies. If something is going terribly wrong you can branch directly of the Master Branch and merge directly
			back onto the Master Branch</p>
